# SteepUpServer

SteepUp is an app that predicts your time on a specific track based on any previously recorded performance.

You can record yourself on any track and the app will analyse your performance on different factors to create a profile. This profile can then be used by other users with similar profiles to estimate their own time on your tracks.
The concept of a ghost is provided to be able to compete with your, or any users, best time on a specific track in real time and analyse where you are losing time to then train accordingly.

This app will focus on mountain sports where altitude, difference in altitude, terrain and weather make time prediction very tricky for humans.

As a first step, the app will only be available on Android.

# The server

This is the code base of the server and the Web app. It's built on top of the Play Framework.
